## Introduction

### Background

This problem tests algorithmic problem-solving skills.

## Assignment Description

### Grade Composition

| Grading Component | Percentage |
| :--: | :--: |
| Pass **2056. Falling Balls** | 80% |
| Code Review | 20% |

Here are several points that need clarification:

- In the Code Review, we will **strictly examine your code style and repository organization structure, etc.**

- This assignment provides some sample data for testing, stored in the `/workspace/data/087/data_test/` directory. Note that these are not the test cases on the Online Judge. Passing all local test cases does not guarantee that you will pass the OJ tests.

- Besides the provided sample data, we also encourage you to design your own test data based on your program logic to assist debugging.

## Assignment Requirements

### Problem Description

$2^{D}-1$  个开关排列成深度为  $D$  的二叉树， 最初都为关闭状态。有  $n$  个小球从顶端依次落下， 并遵循如下规则：

1. 如果经过一个关闭的开关, 则开关打开, 小球落向左侧；

2. 如果经过一个打开的开关, 则开关关闭, 小球落向右侧；

输入  $D, n$ ，输出最后一个小球最终落到的位置和此时所有叶节点的开关状态。

### Input Format

一行输入两个正整数数$D, n$

### Output Format

第一行输出最后一个小球最终落到的位置；

第二行所有叶节点的开关状态（从左到右），1为开，0为关，用空格分割。

### Samples

#### Sample 1

**Input:**
```
4 3
```

**Output:**
```
10
1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
```

### Data Constraints

$1\le D \le 20$

$1\le n \le 10^9$

## Per-Testcase Resource Limits

- **Time Limit (per test case)**: 1500 ms
- **Memory Limit (per test case)**: 244 MiB
- **Disk Usage**: No disk usage is permitted.

## Test Data

The test data for this problem is located at `/workspace/data/087/data_test/`.

## Submission Requirements

### OJ Git Repository Compilation Process

For Git compilation, we will first clone the repository using a command similar to:
```bash
git clone <repo_url> . --depth 1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules --no-local
```

Then we check if there is a `CMakeLists.txt` file. If it exists, we run (if not, a warning message will be displayed):
```bash
cmake .
```

Finally, we check if there is any of `GNUmakefile`/`makefile`/`Makefile` (if cmake was run previously, this will be the generated Makefile). If it exists, we run (if not, a warning message will be displayed):
```bash
make
```

After this process is complete, we will use the `code` file in the project root directory as the compilation result.

A `CMakeLists.txt` file is provided in the project. You can use or modify it as needed. The local environment has gcc-13 and g++-13 available.

### Git Configuration Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: You must create a `.gitignore` file in your project root directory to avoid OJ evaluation conflicts.

The `.gitignore` file should include at least the following entries:

```gitignore
CMakeFiles/
CMakeCache.txt
```

### Submission Guidelines

- The submitted code must be able to compile successfully through the above compilation process
- The compiled executable file name must be `code`
- The program needs to be able to read data from standard input and write results to standard output
- Please ensure the code runs correctly within the given time and space limits
- **You must use C++ or C language** to implement this assignment

### Evaluation Notes

- The evaluation system will test your program using the provided test data
- The program output must exactly match the expected output (including format)
- Exceeding time or memory limits will be judged as the corresponding error type
- Please pay attention to the overall time performance of your code and the time complexity of each part of your algorithm.

### Academic Integrity

If any violations are found during evaluation or code review (including but not limited to using unconventional methods to pass test cases), your final score may be significantly reduced or become **0 points**.
