## Introduction

### Background

This problem tests algorithmic problem-solving skills.

## Assignment Description

### Grade Composition

| Grading Component | Percentage |
| :--: | :--: |
| Pass **2452. 二叉搜索树的节点寻找** | 80% |
| Code Review | 20% |

Here are several points that need clarification:

- In the Code Review, we will **strictly examine your code style and repository organization structure, etc.**

- This assignment provides some sample data for testing, stored in the `/workspace/data/098/data_test/` directory. Note that these are not the test cases on the Online Judge. Passing all local test cases does not guarantee that you will pass the OJ tests.

- Besides the provided sample data, we also encourage you to design your own test data based on your program logic to assist debugging.

## Assignment Requirements

### Problem Description

在小组作业中，每个小组成员信息以二叉搜索树形式存储，每个小组有七位组员，节点的值为学生的学号。
请编写程序返回第 cnt 大的学生学号。
* 二叉搜索树是一种树形数据结构，其中每个节点的左子树节点值小于该节点，右子树节点值大于该节点，并且左右子树也都是二叉搜索树。
* 要求用二叉搜索树求解

### Input Format

一共八个整数，中间以回车分割。
前七个整数，表示二叉搜索树的节点值。每个值代表一个学生的学号。按照层序遍历（即按从上到下、从左到右的顺序）记录二叉搜索树的结构。假设学生的学号不重复。
最后一个整数，表示需要返回的第 cnt 大的学生学号。

### Output Format

一个整数，表示二叉搜索树中第 cnt 大的学生学号。

### Data Constraints



## Per-Testcase Resource Limits

- **Time Limit (per test case)**: 1000 ms
- **Memory Limit (per test case)**: 244 MiB
- **Disk Usage**: No disk usage is permitted.

## Test Data

The test data for this problem is located at `/workspace/data/098/data_test/`.

## Submission Requirements

### OJ Git Repository Compilation Process

For Git compilation, we will first clone the repository using a command similar to:
```bash
git clone <repo_url> . --depth 1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules --no-local
```

Then we check if there is a `CMakeLists.txt` file. If it exists, we run (if not, a warning message will be displayed):
```bash
cmake .
```

Finally, we check if there is any of `GNUmakefile`/`makefile`/`Makefile` (if cmake was run previously, this will be the generated Makefile). If it exists, we run (if not, a warning message will be displayed):
```bash
make
```

After this process is complete, we will use the `code` file in the project root directory as the compilation result.

A `CMakeLists.txt` file is provided in the project. You can use or modify it as needed. The local environment has gcc-13 and g++-13 available.

### Git Configuration Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: You must create a `.gitignore` file in your project root directory to avoid OJ evaluation conflicts.

The `.gitignore` file should include at least the following entries:

```gitignore
CMakeFiles/
CMakeCache.txt
```

### Submission Guidelines

- The submitted code must be able to compile successfully through the above compilation process
- The compiled executable file name must be `code`
- The program needs to be able to read data from standard input and write results to standard output
- Please ensure the code runs correctly within the given time and space limits
- **You must use C++ or C language** to implement this assignment

### Evaluation Notes

- The evaluation system will test your program using the provided test data
- The program output must exactly match the expected output (including format)
- Exceeding time or memory limits will be judged as the corresponding error type
- Please pay attention to the overall time performance of your code and the time complexity of each part of your algorithm.

### Academic Integrity

If any violations are found during evaluation or code review (including but not limited to using unconventional methods to pass test cases), your final score may be significantly reduced or become **0 points**.
