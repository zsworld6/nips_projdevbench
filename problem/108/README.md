## Introduction

### Background

This problem tests algorithmic problem-solving skills.

## Assignment Description

### Grade Composition

| Grading Component | Percentage |
| :--: | :--: |
| Pass **1062. 有限背包** | 80% |
| Code Review | 20% |

Here are several points that need clarification:

- In the Code Review, we will **strictly examine your code style and repository organization structure, etc.**

- This assignment provides some sample data for testing, stored in the `/workspace/data/108/data_test/` directory. Note that these are not the test cases on the Online Judge. Passing all local test cases does not guarantee that you will pass the OJ tests.

- Besides the provided sample data, we also encourage you to design your own test data based on your program logic to assist debugging.

## Assignment Requirements

### Problem Description

大家都已经学过了01背包问题，现在这个问题稍微有一些变化：第i种物品可能有pi个，你可以选取任意个（小于pi)。给定背包容量m，求背包能达到的最大价值。

### Input Format

第1行有2个整数n, m，表示要有n种物品，背包容量为m 第2到n+1行，每行三个整数pi, wi, vi，分别表示该种物品有pi个，每个物品重wi，价值为vi

### Output Format

输出一个数字， 表示背包能达到的最大价值。

### Samples

#### Sample 1

**Input:**
```
3 9
1 2 3
2 3 4
3 4 5
```

**Output:**
```
12
```

### Data Constraints

对于80%的数据，$ 1 \leq n \leq 1000 $，$ 1 \leq m \leq 1000 $, $ 1 \leq sumP=p1+p2+...+pn \leq 2000 $ 

对于100%的数据，$ 1 \leq N \leq 1000 $, $ 1 \leq m \leq 1000 $, $ 1 \leq pi \leq 1000 $

## Per-Testcase Resource Limits

- **Time Limit (per test case)**: 200 ms
- **Memory Limit (per test case)**: 64 MiB
- **Disk Usage**: No disk usage is permitted.

## Test Data

The test data for this problem is located at `/workspace/data/108/data_test/`.

## Submission Requirements

### OJ Git Repository Compilation Process

For Git compilation, we will first clone the repository using a command similar to:
```bash
git clone <repo_url> . --depth 1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules --no-local
```

Then we check if there is a `CMakeLists.txt` file. If it exists, we run (if not, a warning message will be displayed):
```bash
cmake .
```

Finally, we check if there is any of `GNUmakefile`/`makefile`/`Makefile` (if cmake was run previously, this will be the generated Makefile). If it exists, we run (if not, a warning message will be displayed):
```bash
make
```

After this process is complete, we will use the `code` file in the project root directory as the compilation result.

A `CMakeLists.txt` file is provided in the project. You can use or modify it as needed. The local environment has gcc-13 and g++-13 available.

### Git Configuration Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: You must create a `.gitignore` file in your project root directory to avoid OJ evaluation conflicts.

The `.gitignore` file should include at least the following entries:

```gitignore
CMakeFiles/
CMakeCache.txt
```

### Submission Guidelines

- The submitted code must be able to compile successfully through the above compilation process
- The compiled executable file name must be `code`
- The program needs to be able to read data from standard input and write results to standard output
- Please ensure the code runs correctly within the given time and space limits
- **You must use C++ or C language** to implement this assignment

### Evaluation Notes

- The evaluation system will test your program using the provided test data
- The program output must exactly match the expected output (including format)
- Exceeding time or memory limits will be judged as the corresponding error type
- Please pay attention to the overall time performance of your code and the time complexity of each part of your algorithm.

### Academic Integrity

If any violations are found during evaluation or code review (including but not limited to using unconventional methods to pass test cases), your final score may be significantly reduced or become **0 points**.
