# Problem 073 - RISC-V CPU (rv32i)

**OJ Problem ID**: 2531

## Introduction

### Background

In this project, you need to design and implement a RISC-V CPU using Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language). The CPU must support the RV32I instruction set and implement a Tomasulo-based out-of-order execution architecture. Your Verilog code will be verified through software simulation, where the CPU executes test programs and the output is compared against expected results.

This is a hardware design project from the ACM Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, based on the [RISCV-CPU project](https://github.com/ACMClassCourses/RISCV-CPU).

## Assignment Description

### Grade Composition

| Grading Component | Percentage |

| Code Review | 15% |

## Assignment Requirements

### Project Overview

You must implement a **speculative, out-of-order execution** RISC-V CPU supporting the **RV32I** instruction set using Verilog. The CPU architecture should follow the Tomasulo algorithm with the following stages:

1. **Issue** - Decode instructions and assign to reservation stations
2. **Execute** - Perform computation when operands are ready
3. **Write Result** - Broadcast results via Common Data Bus (CDB)

An **Instruction Cache** must be implemented to ensure instruction-level parallelism.

### Required Instructions (37 total)

```

### Technical Details

- Memory size: 128KB (addresses below 0x20000)
- Special I/O: reading/writing at 0x30000 and 0x30004 for UART communication
- Execution starts from address 0x0000000
- Register file: 32 general-purpose registers (x0-x31)
- The CPU must handle `rdy_in` (ready) and `rst_in` (reset) signals correctly

### Simulation

```bash
cd riscv
make test_sim name=000  # Run first simulation test
```

## Per-Testcase Resource Limits

- **Simulation Time Limit**: varies per test case
- **Language**: Verilog (submitted via git repository)

## Submission Requirements

### OJ Git Repository Submission

Submit a git repository URL containing your Verilog implementation. The OJ will clone your repository and run simulation tests against the provided testbench.

The repository must follow the structure provided in the [RISCV-CPU template](https://github.com/ACMClassCourses/RISCV-CPU), with your implementation primarily in `riscv/src/cpu.v` and additional module files.

### Evaluation Notes

- The evaluation system runs iVerilog simulation against comprehensive test programs
- Test programs are compiled from C source code using the RISC-V toolchain
- Output must exactly match expected results
- Simulation timeout indicates the CPU is too slow or has infinite loops

### Academic Integrity

If any violations are found during evaluation or code review, your final score may be significantly reduced or become **0 points**.
