## Introduction

### Background

This problem tests algorithmic problem-solving skills.

## Assignment Description

### Grade Composition

| Grading Component | Percentage |
| :--: | :--: |
| Pass **1050. 分割海岛** | 80% |
| Code Review | 20% |

Here are several points that need clarification:

- In the Code Review, we will **strictly examine your code style and repository organization structure, etc.**

- This assignment provides some sample data for testing, stored in the `/workspace/data/106/data_test/` directory. Note that these are not the test cases on the Online Judge. Passing all local test cases does not guarantee that you will pass the OJ tests.

- Besides the provided sample data, we also encourage you to design your own test data based on your program logic to assist debugging.

## Assignment Requirements

### Problem Description

在一片海域里面有 $N$ 个海岛连成了树的形状，即互相连通。现在我们想去掉一个海岛 $U$ 把整片连通区域分割成更小的连通区域，并且希望满足每个小连通区域的海岛数量不超过 $k$，请根据输入的海岛区域信息来输出所有可能使分割愿望成立的海岛 $U$ 的编号（保证给出的海岛信息可以构成一棵树）。

### Input Format

第 1 行，两个整数 $n$ 和 $k$，代表有 $n$ 个海岛，且每个海岛的编号为 $1,2,\ldots,n$。

第 2～n 行，每行两个整数 $a,b$，代表海岛 $a$ 和海岛 $b$ 之间连通。

### Output Format

一行，如果没有符合条件的海岛  $U$，则输出 None，

如果有，从大到小依次输出所有满足条件的海岛 $U$ 的编号，用空格分开。

### Samples

#### Sample 1

**Input:**
```
10 5
1 7
4 7
6 1
8 4
9 4
5 6
2 1
3 1
10 8
```

**Output:**
```
7 1
```

### Data Constraints

对于百分之三十的数据，$1<k<n\leq 30$

对于百分之六十的数据，$1<k<n\leq 1000$

对于百分之百的数据，$1<k<n\leq 10^5$

## Per-Testcase Resource Limits

- **Time Limit (per test case)**: 1000 ms
- **Memory Limit (per test case)**: 64 MiB
- **Disk Usage**: No disk usage is permitted.

## Test Data

The test data for this problem is located at `/workspace/data/106/data_test/`.

## Submission Requirements

### OJ Git Repository Compilation Process

For Git compilation, we will first clone the repository using a command similar to:
```bash
git clone <repo_url> . --depth 1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules --no-local
```

Then we check if there is a `CMakeLists.txt` file. If it exists, we run (if not, a warning message will be displayed):
```bash
cmake .
```

Finally, we check if there is any of `GNUmakefile`/`makefile`/`Makefile` (if cmake was run previously, this will be the generated Makefile). If it exists, we run (if not, a warning message will be displayed):
```bash
make
```

After this process is complete, we will use the `code` file in the project root directory as the compilation result.

A `CMakeLists.txt` file is provided in the project. You can use or modify it as needed. The local environment has gcc-13 and g++-13 available.

### Git Configuration Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: You must create a `.gitignore` file in your project root directory to avoid OJ evaluation conflicts.

The `.gitignore` file should include at least the following entries:

```gitignore
CMakeFiles/
CMakeCache.txt
```

### Submission Guidelines

- The submitted code must be able to compile successfully through the above compilation process
- The compiled executable file name must be `code`
- The program needs to be able to read data from standard input and write results to standard output
- Please ensure the code runs correctly within the given time and space limits
- **You must use C++ or C language** to implement this assignment

### Evaluation Notes

- The evaluation system will test your program using the provided test data
- The program output must exactly match the expected output (including format)
- Exceeding time or memory limits will be judged as the corresponding error type
- Please pay attention to the overall time performance of your code and the time complexity of each part of your algorithm.

### Academic Integrity

If any violations are found during evaluation or code review (including but not limited to using unconventional methods to pass test cases), your final score may be significantly reduced or become **0 points**.
