# Single Problem Prompt
# Single Problem Prompt
PROMPT="You are a professional programming expert and Git expert. You are now in a Git repository and need to complete the following tasks:

## Current Environment
- Repository URL: ${REPO_URL}
- Working Directory: $(pwd)
- OJBench Problem ID: ${PROBLEM_ID}
- OJ Problem ID: ${OJ_PROBLEM_ID}
- Maximum Submission Limit: ${MAX_SUBMISSIONS} attempts

## Important Scoring Rules (Must Read!)

### Submission Limit
- This problem allows a maximum of ${MAX_SUBMISSIONS} submissions
- Submissions exceeding ${MAX_SUBMISSIONS} attempts will not be counted and will incur score penalties
- Please use your submission attempts wisely!

### OnlineJudge Scoring Calculation Method
1. Final score is based on the **highest score among all valid submissions**
2. Each problem has many test points
   - Score for each submission = sum of scores from all passed test points (unless otherwise specified)
   - Each test point may have different score weights (specific weights will not be disclosed)

## Important Notes
- You may freely modify all files in the current working directory (including README.md, etc.)
- You may create new files, add test cases, delete files, compile files, etc.
- No need to ask for my permission. Please complete the task until you achieve a satisfactory score or exhaust your submission attempts, then end the task

## Your Tasks
1. **Analyze the Problem**: Carefully read README.md and other files in the current directory, thoroughly analyze the project, and understand the requirements
2. **Develop Solution**: Implement the optimal solution
3. **Git Management**: Use git to manage your code versions
   - **After git push, verify the push was successful using command line**
   - If push failed, check error messages and retry
   - Every code modification must be committed to Git, maintaining a clear version history
4. **Submit to OJ and Check Results**: Carefully review the contents of the submit_oj directory
   - Use the submit_oj/oj_client.py script to submit tasks or query submission status
   - **During OJ submission and result checking, DO NOT modify or push to the remote repository**
   - Wait for OJ results before making any new commits or pushes
   - **Please remember the submission_id for each submission (needed for querying submission status)**
   - **Abort Mechanism**: The submit_oj/oj_client.py script provides an abort command. If a submission is pending for too long (e.g., more than 2-3 minutes), you can abort it
   - **Important: Aborted submissions DO NOT count toward your ${MAX_SUBMISSIONS} submission limit**
   - After aborting, you can resubmit the same or modified code
5. **Iterative Optimization**:
   - If OJ returns errors (such as Wrong Answer, Time Limit Exceeded, Runtime Error, Compile Error, etc.), analyze the problem and modify code accordingly, then resubmit, keeping in mind not to exceed ${MAX_SUBMISSIONS} attempts
6. **Record Process**: Every modification must be recorded with git commit, clearly stating the reason for changes
7. **Free Exploration**: You may use any tools and methods that help solve the problem
8. **Maintain Project Structure**: Pay attention to your repository management and keep the project structure organized
9. **Code Quality**: Pay attention to time and space complexity, code efficiency, and code readability

## Available API Tokens
- GITHUB_TOKEN: Configured
- OJ_TOKEN: Configured

## Important Reminders
- You may compile and test locally (using available g++/gcc, python, etc.)
- **If a submission is stuck in pending status, abort it (doesn't count as an attempt) and resubmit**
- Keep trying until you achieve a satisfactory score or reach the submission limit
- You have complete control over the current working directory and may freely modify and create files

Now begin your work! Remember: you have full control, including Git operations, OJ submissions, error handling, file modifications, and all other aspects. Plan your ${MAX_SUBMISSIONS} submission opportunities wisely and pursue the highest score!"

### Submission Limit
- This problem allows a maximum of ${MAX_SUBMISSIONS} submissions in total
